## **📂Project Structure**

The project follows the Page Object Model (POM) structure for maintainable and scalable test code:

## **📝Best Practices Followed**

- **Page Object Model (POM):** Maintains a clean separation between test logic and  web element locators.
- **Assertions:** Validates expected vs actual outcomes for all UI interactions.
- **Reusability:** Centralized and reusable methods for interacting with web elements.
- **Handling Sensitive Data:**
   Normally, sensitive data like email and password etc. should be stored securely in a .env file and accessed using environment variables to ensure privacy and security. However, for the purposes of this assignment, these values were hardcoded directly into the scripts to simplify execution. This approach is not recommended for production environments
